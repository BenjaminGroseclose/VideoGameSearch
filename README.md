# VideoGameSearch

I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to show my skills. I look forward to discussing it with you in the future.

Additional things I would have like to accomplished:
- A better UI design, I understand the need for a beautiful UI when it comes to mobile development and while I would not consider this app to be ugly, I would admit it could use a bit more love.
- Implement MVP design pattern, I chose to not go forward this due to the small size of the application however if I were dealing with another larger than this would have looked to develop it out in an MVP format.
- Created a second page that would give more details about the game. 
- Created a last search list.

Other Notes:

- I question if the Pull to Refresh functionality was a good idea, still aren't fully sure of it though when you are working with a list I think it is familiar for users to have an ability to refresh.
