# VideoGameSearch

I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to show my skills. I look forward to dicussing in with you in the future.

Additional things I would have like to achomplished:
- A better UI design, I understand the need for a beautiful UI when it comes to mobile development and while I would not consider this app to be ugly, I would admit it could use a bit more love.
- Implement MVP design pattern, I chose to not go forward this this due to the small size of the application however if I were dealing with another larger than this would have looked to develop it out in a an MVP format.
- Handle

Other Notes:

- I question if the Pull to Refresh functionality was a good idea, still aren't fully sure of it though when you are working with a list I think it is familiar for users to have a ability to refresh.
